### Repository Structure

The repository includes this main file:
`ADM-HW2.ipynb`
This file contains all the project about an analysis of a Kaggle dataset about the Steam platform, focusing on user reviews and engagement patterns. It starts with an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and main features of the dataset. Then, it answers specific questions, like finding which games have the most and fewest reviews, examining how reviews are distributed across different games, and looking at differences in review behavior between users who bought a game and those who got it for free.

The project also looks at trends over time, identifying peak times of day and year when users are most active in submitting reviews. Another area of focus is the relationship between the amount of time users spend on an application and the review scores they give, to see if more experienced users tend to give higher or lower ratings. The top reviewers are also analyzed by looking at their language preferences, the quality of their reviews based on helpful votes, and which games they review most frequently.

Additionally, the project compares behaviors between English and Spanish-speaking reviewers, like their tendency to edit reviews and the average number of games they own. Statistical tests are used throughout to check different hypotheses, including whether users with bigger game libraries leave fewer reviews.

Besides the numbers, the project includes sentiment analysis on review texts in the top three languages, classifying reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. This sentiment is then compared with the recommendations and helpful votes to get more insights. Finally, thereâ€™s an algorithmic question that involves breaking down an integer into parts of the same parity, adding a computational challenge to the project.

# Important Notes
  The interactive plots doesn't show directly in the GitHub window of the `ADM-HW2.ipynb`, so we are going to share this link if you would like to interact with them [NotebookLink](https://nbviewer.org/github/delgiudice1967219/ADM_HW2/blob/main/ADM-HW2.ipynb) and also we attach them as `.png`.
